# set in python
# methods

# l = [12, 33, 44, 55, 66]
# access
# print(l[4])
# print(l[1:-1:1])

# add
# l.append(55)
# l.insert(1,55)
# l.extend([55,44,33,22])

# delete
# print(l.remove(33))
# print(l.pop())  # by default it remove the last element from the list
# print(l.clear())
# del l[2]
# del l[2:5]

# update
# var[index]=value

# l.count(55)
# print(l.count(55))

# l.reverse()

# l.sort()  # - mutable method is used to sort the list
# print(l)

# print(sorted(l))  # sorted is a immutable function takes iterable object

l.sort(reverse=True)  # - mutable method is used to sort the list
# print(l)

# print(sorted(l,reverse=False))  # sorted is a immutable function takes iterable object

# - all of these methods only posible on a list because list is mutable and ordered


# --
# set - set is a comma separated values within curly brasese {}
# syntax :
# var = {v1,v3,v3....} # variable name with values

# explain - set is unordered collection of unique elements , it will never maintain the sequence of it ,

# unordered -
# roll1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, "asdf", 7, 8, 9}
# print(roll1)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 'asdf'}

# mutable -
# roll = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
# roll.add(70)
# print(roll)

# "set" is a heterogeneous collection of immutable elements/objects ,
# means all fundamental data types can be stored inside set

# heterogeneous collection -
# s1 = {23, 44, "hello", 2.3, True}
# print(s1)

# duplicate value is not allowed in set
# s2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
# print(s2) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} - duplicate value is not allowed it will not print the duplicate value

# how to add data  -  add
