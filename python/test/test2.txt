 1.
 python is a high level programming language ,easy to learn, used in multiple
 domains ,it contains features like is an 1. interpreted language , 2. simple to learn and 3. used in multiple domains like web development , data science , machine learning , artificial intelligence and 4. it's dynamically typed language

 2.
 python is a platform independent , it can be create and used in any operating system , it's portable means you can develop an application in one os(operating system) and run it in any other os without changing the code.

 3.
 python is created by guido van rossum and first released in 1991

 4.
 variable is a container used to store value
 example - first = "hello world"

 5.
 list                                            tuple
 mutable                                         immutable
 square brackets [1,2]                           parentheses(1,2)

 6.
 set is a unique collection of unordered items,it is mutable and heterogeneous in nature, duplicate value is not allowed in it
 example -
 fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}
 print(fruits)  {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'

 7.
 dictionary is a collection of mutable key-value pairs, it's nature is heterogeneous, duplicate key is not allowed in it but the duplicate value is allowed.
 example -
vivo_x200 = {
    "brand": "vivo",
    "model": "x200",
    "color": "black",
    "ram": "12gb",
    "storage": "256gb",
    "price": 78000,
}

 8.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
a.append(7)   to add a single element to the list
a.extend([8, 9, 10])   to add multiple elements to the list
a.index(5)   to check the index of the value
a.pop()   default value is last
a.pop(2)   to delete the value based on the index
a.clear()   to clear the list

 9.
 dic = {"name": "ketan", "age": 23, "city": "pune", "country": "india"}
 dic.get("name")  it will return the value of the key and if the key is not available then it will not throw any error
 s = dic.values()  it will give you the values of the dictionary
 s = dic.items()  return a list of dict's key-value pairs as tuple
 e = dic.keys()  return a list of dict's keys
 e = dic.clear()  it will clear the dict
 print(e)

 10.
 for loop used to iterate collection of data such as list,tuple,dict and execute code once for each item in the collection .
 example
 fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

 for fruit in fruits:
 print(f"I like {fruit}")

 11.
 r = {'name': 'ketan', 'age': 23, 'city': 'pune', 'country': 'india'}
 for a in r.values():
 print(a)  ketan 23 pune india

 12.
 r = {"name": "ketan", "age": 23, "city": "pune", "country": "india"}
 for x, y in r.items():
     print(x)  name age city country
     print(y)  ketan 23 pune india
