# variable name can be alpha-numeric but it should not start with numbers and special characters

# in this case the 103.234 is stored in a memory location and petrol_price is a variable name(object refrence)


# it is case sensitive -- it will print both of them , because both are in the memory location with the diffrent names("C"ourse and "c"ourse)
# course = "web development"
# Course = "web"
# print(course)

# course = "web development"
#  after creating a object the PMM(python memory manager) will allocate memory to the object

# course = "web development"
# course = "web"

# print(course) # it will print web not web development

# ---

# PMM(python memory manager) - it will allocate memory to the object with the help of a refrence name
# gc(garbage collector) - it will dealocate memory to the object

# gc -- if a object does not have a refrence name then it will dealocate the memory

# Module - A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements (functions, classes, and variables) that can be reused in other Python programs
# Package - it is a collection of modules and sub-packages that can be imported

# -- if i want to use data from a module then i have to import that module using - "import module_name"
